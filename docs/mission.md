Standard Template Construct's mission is providing a software tools for training Artificial Intelligence for assisting following human tasks:
1. Book Reading
2. Operating desktop computer
3. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle operation 
4. operation of stationary manufacturing equipment using humanoid body

book reading
Human reading book or other publication using mobile device consumes PDF file or audiobook file. 
software features include:

- [ ] file acquisition and cataloging
- [ ] display PDF and ePUB
- [ ] playback of audiobooks with synchronization with text
- [ ] synchronization between users devices
- [ ] translation from foreign language 
- [ ] highlights (quotes) collection in BibiTEX
- [ ] sharing of quotes and books between users


operating desktop computer
human operating desktop computer reads text on screen, inputs text from keyboard, interacts with GUI using mouse, uses hotkeys. goal of operating computer could be expressed as text prompt, result - is a side effect of the operation of the computer. in some activities, such as software engineering, result and all intermediary steps could be easily represented as text fragments as well.

UAV operation
human aerial drone operator uses remote controller, video streamed from onboard camera of drone, telemetry data and geopositional data received from network to position drone in space so specific points on the ground would be visible from drone cameras. Additionally, he visually recognizes objects of interest on the ground similiar to ones on the geopositional data received from network, and transmits their geo position, and updates geo position of known objects 

operation of stationary manufacturing equipment using humanoid body
Human operates stationary manufacturing equipment by picking up, positioning in space various objects, operating buttons, knobs, levers of manufacturing equipment and operating desktop computer connected to manufacturing equipment. 
input for this task is a collection of files - blueprints, schematics, etc, and detailed text instruction. output - timed sequence of movement of the humanoid body, coordinated with visual signals from stationary equipment + timed sequence of desktop computer operation instructions.
